            <h2>About Anagha Cleaners</h2>
            <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> A NASA report revealed that the air inside our homes could be more toxic
                than the air outside, and much of this pollution comes from the cleaning products we use daily.
                In India, a study shows an alarming rise in skin conditions like dermatitis and respiratory issues such as asthma, particularly among children. Harmful chemicals in common household cleaners are a significant cause.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Anagha Cleaners is Different</h3>
